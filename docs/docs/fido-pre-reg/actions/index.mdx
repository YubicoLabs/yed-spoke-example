# Custom actions

Over the next couple of sections we will be configuring the various actions that are required to facilitate the FIDO Pre-reg orchestration. The first set of actions will be focused on the API calls made against the YubiEnterprise Delivery API. The second set of actions will be based on the various configurations needed for a specific IdP.

:::danger
Please ensure that you have generated and configured the API tokens before proceeding. Instructions for this can be found in the previous section [Configure connection credentials](/yed-spoke-example/docs/fido-pre-reg/connections)
