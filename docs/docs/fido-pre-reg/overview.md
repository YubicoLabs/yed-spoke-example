# FIDO Pre-reg overview

With Yubico FIDO Pre-reg, an IT administrator can use the YubiEnterprise Delivery API together with an identity provider's (IdP) FIDO2 API to order pre-registered YubiKeys for end-users. The keys are pre-registered and shipped directly to the specific end user with a login credential for immediate use.

This guide will build off of the concepts introduced in the earlier sections of this guide, and does not require the implementation of a non-FIDO Pre-reg YubiEnterprise shipment flow.
